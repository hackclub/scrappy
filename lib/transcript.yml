      WoooOOOAAAh there! You can only share images or videos in <#${process.env.CHANNEL}>! I've deleted your message:

      ${this.text}

      But feel free to repost it with an image or video and I'll let it be :eye::lips::eye:
  css:
    'noargs': To link a custom CSS file, type \`/scrappy setcss\` followed by a link to a CSS file online. Try this one, which sets your background to hot pink! \`/scrappy setcss https://gist.github.com/MatthewStanciu/a0c10a8d4264b737fcc3c1724591c232\`
    'removed': Your CSS file has been removed from your profile. If you would like to re-add it, type \`/scrappy setcss <link to css file>\`.
    'set': '<${this.url}|Your CSS file> has been linked to your profile! Check it out: \`https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/${this.username}\`'
    'nocss': You linked a Gist, but there isn’t a .css file on your Gist. Try again with the raw URL to the CSS.
    'broadcast': Anyone can now click the button below to add this CSS style to their scrapbook! <${this.scrapbookLink}|See it live on this profile>.
  domain:
    'noargs': To link a custom domain to your scrapbook, type \`/scrappy setdomain\` followed by the domain or subdomain you want to link. e.g. \`/scrappy setdomain zachlatta.com\`. Then, create a CNAME record in your DNS provider for your domain and point it to \`cname.vercel-dns.com\`.
    'overlimit': Couldn't set your domain. Only 50 custom domains can be added to a project, and 50 people have already added their custom domains.
    'domainexists': Couldn't set your domain \`${this.text}\`. You can't add a domain if it's already set to another Vercel project. Try again with a different domain.
    'domainset':
      - |
        Custom domain \`${this.text}\` set!
        
        *Your next steps*: create a CNAME record in your DNS provider for your domain and point it to \`cname.vercel-dns.com\`.

        You're one of 50 people who can add a custom domain during the Summer of Making. There are *${this.domainsLeft}* domains spots left.
  webrings:
    'add': <@${this.webringUser}> has been added to your webrings!
    'remove': <@${this.webringUser}> has been removed from your webrings.
    'noargs': Webrings are a way to link to your friends' scrapbooks in your scrapbook, and to receive scrapbook updates from your friends when you post. To add someone to your webring, type \`/scrappy webring add/remove @username\`
    'invalidaction': You must specify whether to add or remove a webring. e.g. \`/scrappy webring add @user\` or \`/scrappy webring remove @user\`
    'invaliduser':
      - |
        I couldn't find that user :thunj: Make sure you're tagging the user, and make sure they're a Scrapbook user.
    'alreadyadded': <@${this.webringUser}> has already been added to your webring!
    'alreadyremoved': <@${this.webringUser}> has already been removed from your webring!
  profileUpdate: Your profile details have been updated! ${this.scrapbookLink}
  assetReady: <@${this.user}> Your video has been processed and is live on your scrapbook!
  errors:
    'filetype': Your filetype isn't supported. Make sure you\'re uploading a photo or video and try again.
    'heic': The HEIC filetype isn't supported. I recommend <https://heictojpg.com|converting your image to jpg> and reuploading.
    'bigvideo':
      - |
        Woweee!!! What's that??? That file is so big...I don't have enough memory for it...

        Since I can't download this file, I'm going to make it "public" via Slack's API and upload it to your scrapbook that way. The update will be live on your scrapbook in 30 seconds, but it'll take anywhere between 30 seconds and a few minutes for it to be viewable. I'll notify you when it's ready.
        
        (PS: You may receive a notification from Slackbot—go ahead and ignore it.)
    'bigimage': What are you trying to do with that massive image—kill me?

    toolong: Wowwwwzaaaa, so many people! I have stage fright so you can only add 8 people to your webring....

  css:
    'noargs': To link a custom CSS file, type \`/scrappy setcss\` followed by a link to a CSS file online. Try this one, which sets your background to hot pink! \`/scrappy setcss https://gist.github.com/MatthewStanciu/a0c10a8d4264b737fcc3c1724591c232\`
    'removed': Your CSS file has been removed from your profile. If you would like to re-add it, type \`/scrappy setcss <link to css file>\`.

    'nocss': You linked a Gist, but there isn’t a .css file on your Gist. Try again with the raw URL to the CSS.

  audio:
    noargs: To link a custom sound file to your scrapbook, type \`scrappy setsound\` followed by a sound file url.

    set: Woohoo! Check out your new tunes at ${this.url}.
    notaccepted: Your file doesn't contain an accepted audio filetype. Try reuploading a file that ends in mp3, aiff, wav, or m4a.

    'domainexists': Couldn't set your domain \`${this.text}\`. You can't add a domain if it's already set to another Vercel project. Try again with a different domain.
    'domainset':

        Custom domain \`${this.text}\` set!

        *Your next steps*: create a CNAME record in your DNS provider for your domain and point it to \`cname.vercel-dns.com\`.

        You're one of 50 people who can add a custom domain during the Summer of Making. There are *${this.domainsLeft}* domains spots left.

    'filetype': Your filetype isn't supported. Make sure you\'re uploading a photo or video and try again.

    'bigvideo':

        Woweee!!! What's that??? That file is so big...I don't have enough memory for it...

        Since I can't download this file, I'm going to make it "public" via Slack's API and upload it to your scrapbook that way. The update will be live on your scrapbook in 30 seconds, but it'll take anywhere between 30 seconds and a few minutes for it to be viewable. I'll notify you when it's ready.

        (PS: You may receive a notification from Slackbot—go ahead and ignore it.)
    'bigimage': What are you trying to do with that massive image—kill me?
    'zach': Zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just tried to update your streak, but <@U4QAK9SRW> reinstalled me with his Slack tokens at some point, so it didn\'t work. When you get a chance, reinstall me with your tokens and update the env variables in the Heroku deployment. Then toggle \`/scrappy displaystreaks\` off and on again.

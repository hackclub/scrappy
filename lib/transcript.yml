    Hey there <@{this.user}>! I hope you brought your gluestix and silly-scissors!

    For the @staff who built me, a key part in their learning journey was _showing up every day_. <#${process.env.CHANNEL}> is a place to post what you're learning, making, and doing every day. It keeps a streak of how many consecutive days you've been doing it and sets your Slack status accordingly, generating a beautiful website with your progress along the way at https://scrapbook.hackclub.com.

    <#${process.env.CHANNEL}> will only be open from June 18th - August 15th for the Summer of Making. To get started, post a photo or video of something you've been up to today.

    Want to see what others are doing? See <@UARKJATPW>'s scrapbook at https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/clairebookworm or <@U0C7B14Q3>'s at https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/msw/.

    If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to staff in <#C0C78SG9L> :-).

# Scrappy

### The bot that ate trash

Scrappy is a client to use [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com), Hack Club's social media. This is an in-development version, which plans to be compatible with v2 of Scrapbook ([in development here](https://github.com/hackclub/scrapbook))

#### Roadmap

Currently, all effort is placed towards bringing feature-parity with the current version of scrappy - if you want any features do let us know in #scrapbook-dev!
